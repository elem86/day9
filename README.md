# Day 9

🎯 Day 9 – One Project a Day Until I Get Hired

🔍 Joins + Window Functions in SQL

Today’s project combined two key SQL concepts: table joins and window functions to simulate a real-world athlete ranking scenario.


✅ What I did:

 - Created two mock datasets:

   - athletes: 200 male athletes with IDs, names, and countries

   - results: 180 of them with 100m sprint times (in seconds)

 - Imported both into SQLite

 - Used INNER and LEFT JOIN to explore how different join types affect the result set

 - Applied RANK() window function to:

    - Rank athletes globally by time

    - Compare results by country

    - Handle ties (e.g., same sprint time)


🏁 This mini-project shows how SQL can be used to analyze and rank performance data — a key step in sports analytics and many other domains.

🕒 Time spent: ~1 hour
